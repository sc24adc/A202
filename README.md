Research Question:
Is there a difference in the proportions of sales revenue across different product categories in various region?

Independent Variable:
By using product category as an independent variable when examining sales and product details for clothing and accessories across different regions, businesses can better understand regional preferences, optimize sales strategies, segment the market, and manage inventory. Businesses can find useful information that guides pricing, promotions, stock allocation, and product development initiatives in various geographical areas by separating the effects of product categories. Eventually, this strategy increases market share in a variety of geographical regions, boosts customer satisfaction, and increases profitability. 
Product category is considered a nominal data type because it represents a categorical variable that divides data into distinct groups or categories without any inherent order or ranking.
 Nominal data is often used to represent qualitative attributes (such as types) rather than quantitative measurements. Product categories describe the type of product, such as menswear, womenswear, accessories, or sportswear, without any numeric or ordered value.

Dependent Variable:
By using sales revenue as the dependent variable makes it simpler to compare regional performance. By taking into consideration variations in market maturity, local economic conditions, and population size, it provides a clear image of the areas in which the business is most successful.
Sales revenue is a continuous variable that measures the total income generated from the sale of products over a specific time period.
